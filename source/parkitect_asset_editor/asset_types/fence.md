# Fence

Fences are like draggable walls. They have a 'flat' and optionally a 'post'. The flat will be the object itself. Therefore you should model your flat and post seperately. Drag the flat object to the 'Drop to add' field to make it an asset.

## Color settings

Every object support custom colors. Check [this](Custom-colors) page for more info on custom color settings.

## Fence settings

**Post**: if the fence should have a post you can drag the post game object from the scene to this field. This will make the post game object a child of the fence object called 'Post'.

**Has mid posts**: whether the fence has mid posts.
